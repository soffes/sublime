# Sublime

This is my Sublime Text 3 configuration. Most of the interesting stuff is in [Packages/User](Packages/User).

If you just want to take a look at my preference and not copy everything, have a look at my [Preferences.sublime-settings](Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings).

## Install

    $ rm -rf ~/Library/Application \Support\Sublime\ Text\ 3
    $ git clone https://github.com/soffes/sublime.git ~/Library/Application\ Support\Sublime\ Text\ 3
